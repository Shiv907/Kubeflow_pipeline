## Kubeflow pipeline from Scratch

Topics covered in Code. 

1. Python function needed to train and predict
2. Creating components from python functions
3. Initialise kubeflow pipeline
4. define the pipeline function and put together all the components
5. Mounting volume for component's output storage
6. Compiling pipeline and generating yaml - it can be directly uploaded to kubeflow and create experiments and runs using UI
7. Create run from pipeline function using the code
8. How to disable cache to see the each steps output on second and successive runs
